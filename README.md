# Odin Project Calculator

## Description

This is a Javascript heavy simple calculator web app. It is part of The Odin Project corriculum. The main focus of this project was to create a visually appealing calculator, and then use javascript to make it functional. The calculator can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations, and has a backspace button to remove the last input. It also has keyboard support, so you can use the number keys and the enter key to perform calculations. I have also added an external log that displays the previous operations as an extra bit. The logs can be cleared by refreshing the page.
